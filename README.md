## Objective: 
- In this lab, we will set up a workspace for Node.js development in order to increase our efficiency. Then, we will learn how to use next-gen JavaScript features

## A. Create an arrow function named “mySum”.
- Your function should accept an arbitrary number of arguments using the REST operator.
- Your function should return the sum of all of its inputs. (I am using JS reduce method)

## B. Put this function in a different module and export it. Then, in this module, import the module that contains your function and call it from this module
- I've created a module named `lab-1.js` and imported `{mySum}` functions from `myFunction` module
