## Objective: 
- In this lab, we will set up a workspace for Node.js development in order to increase our efficiency. Then, we will learn how to use next-gen JavaScript features

## A. Create an arrow function named “mySum”.
- Your function should accept an arbitrary number of arguments using the REST operator.
- Your function should return the sum of all of its inputs. (I am using JS reduce method)

## B. Put this function in a different module and export it. Then, in this module, import the module that contains your function and call it from this module
- I've created a module named `lab-1.js` and imported `{mySum}` functions from `myFunction` module

## C. Create an array of numbers named “myArr”. Your array may have any length (try different lengths to test it). 

## D. Call your function passing as arguments the members of myArr array using the SPREAD operator. Assign the result to a “result” variable and console log it.

## E. Create a new array named “mySecondArr”. Map the contents of your myArr array to mySecondArr array using an anonymous function that multiplies each member of myArr by 2.

## F. Filter the contents of your mySecondArr using an anonymous function that console logs the numbers above average number (you’ll need to find the average first).

## G.  Use setTimeout() function. Pass it a callback function as a parameter that console logs “Goodbye” after 3 seconds.
